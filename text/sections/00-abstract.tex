Public universities employ more lecturers than ever, while state funding for higher education has stagnated for over thirty years.
This paper shows falling state funding caused a substitution away from professors towards lecturers at US public universities, using a shift-share approach to instrument for state funding cuts relative to enrolment.
Universities employ $4.4$\% more lecturers per student following a $10$\% funding cut, relying less on professors by employing $1.4$\% fewer assistant professors and $1.2$\% fewer full professors per student.
Incumbent professors' salaries, promotion rate, and quit rate at Illinois universities are not affected by funding cuts, so that the substitution arose by limiting hiring of new tenure-track/tenured professors.
Stagnating public funding affects public universities as institutions, and likely contributed to deteriorating student outcomes at public universities since the 1990s.

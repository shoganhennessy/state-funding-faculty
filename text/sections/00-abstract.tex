While states have limited their funding for higher education for the last forty years, US universities have systematically substituted away from tenure-track/tenured professors towards contingent lecturers.
This analysis relates the changes the faculty composition at US public universities to the fall in state funding for higher education, using a shift-share approach to identify causal effects.
A $-10$\% fall in a university's funding, via a state funding shock, decreases the number of assistant professors per student by $-1.4$\% and full professors by $-1.2$\%, yet increases the number of lecturers per student by 4.4\%; long-run estimates show the effects linger for multiple years after the initial funding shock.
Analysis of all the professors at Illinois public universities shows that incumbent professors are not affected by substantial funding shocks over 2011-2021, and suggestive evidence shows that the faculty changes arose by falling hires of new professors to replace leaving tenure-track/tenured professors.
These results show the institutional effects of stagnating state funding for higher education, and raise questions about the direction that public education heads as these financial headwinds show no sign of dissipating.

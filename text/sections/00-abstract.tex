US universities have systematically substituted away from tenure-track/tenured professors towards contingent lecturers for the last thirty years, while states have limited how much they fund higher education.
This paper connects the changes the faculty composition at US public universities to the fall in the states' funding for their public universities, using a shift-share approach to instrument for state funding and identify the causal effects of stagnating funding for higher education.
A fall in funding of \$1,000 per student leads to univeristies employing 6 more lecturers on average; relative to enrolment, a fall of $10$\% in funding per student decreases the number of assistant professors per student by $1.4$\% and full professors by $1.2$\%, yet increases the number of lecturers per student by $4.4$\%.
Dynamic estimates show that state funding cuts affect composition of faculty for the next 3 years, showing that funding cuts have lingering effects.
Analysis of all the professors at Illinois public universities shows that incumbent professors' salaries, promotion rate, and quit rate are all are not affected by funding cuts over 2011-2021, implying that the composition change arose by limiting the hiring of new professors to replace leaving tenure-track/tenured professors.
These results show the institutional effects of stagnating state funding for higher education, and raise questions about the direction that public education heads as these financial headwinds show no sign of dissipating.

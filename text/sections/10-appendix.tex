A number of statistical packages, for the $R$ language \citep{R2022}, made the empirical analysis for this paper possible.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Tidyverse} \citep{tidyverse} collected tools for data analysis in the R language.
    \item \textit{LFE} \citep{lfe} implemented linear fixed effect models, with instruments, crucial for the empirical estimation in \autoref{sec:empirics}.

    \textbf{Note}:
    This table shows the summary statistics for every public university--year observation in IPEDS data, for each of the 5 quantiles of the funding shock instrument.
    The column labelled ``1st'' refers to the mean for all university-year observations in the first quintile (bottom 20\%) of the funding shock distribution, and so on.
    The numbers are adjusted to 2021 figures by CPI-U.
    Non-institutional revenues refers to the sum of federal, state, and local funding plus tuition revenues; these sum to the majority of university funding, but exclude numbers such as university income from capital projects.

    This shows that state funding and the funding shock have dynamic correlation, so that dynamic effects must be estimated by local projections -- and not simple OLS or 2SLS.
    The estimates are of \eqref{eqn:firststage}, calculated with IPEDS data, separately for each year relative to initial shock, using the $\log-\log$ specification, including fixed effects for university $+$ year, and clustering standard errors by university $+$ year.

    These results use a $\log-\log$ specification, so the estimates are for the elasticity of state funding per student in a year $t+k$ with respect to funding shock in year $t$, where years $k = 0, \hdots, 10$ are on the x-axis. 
    Standard errors are clustered at the state-year level.

\subsection{Illinois IBHED First Stage}
\label{sec:iv-model-indiv}

This paper uses data on individual professors in the Illinois university system, to investigate the effects of changes in university revenues on the individual professors at the universities.
The outcomes here now refer to individual professors (e.g., their salary and promotion rate), so requires adjustment to the empirical approach, leveraging variation in university funding for the years after a professor joins the university.

\autoref{eqn:rolling-instrument} defines a rolling-share variant of the instrument, $\tilde Z_{j,t}$, where the university's state funding share exposure is based in the year a professor joins the university --- and not the base period 1990--1993.
$j$ indexes each professor in year $t$, $\tau(j)$ for the year the professor first joins their institution.
Identifying $\tau(j)$ is possible for $j$ by restricting to all professors hired 2011-2021 --- i.e., in the years after the start of the full panel.
It is not possible to discern the hiring year for professors who  were hired in the years preceding 2011, and so the entire sample is only possible to analyse using the base-share in years 1990-1993 formulation.

\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:rolling-instrument}
    \tilde Z_{j,t} &\coloneqq - \left[
    \left( \frac{\text{Total State Funding}_{s(j),t}}{\text{Student Population}_{s(j),t}} \right)
    \left( \frac{\text{State Funding}_{\tau(j)}}{\text{Total Revenues}_{i,\tau(j)}} \right) \right]
\end{align}

This approach leverages an insight, made available by level of the data: that an individual professor is affected by changes in university revenues after they have joined the university.
\autoref{sec:iv-model-uni} considers the number of professors employed by the university; whether a professor becomes employed at the university is likely affected by that university's finances.
The formulation here takes as given that the professor is already employed at the university, and then projects the effect of changes in state funding on these \textit{incumbent} professors following the state funding shock.

Exogeneity and relevance of the rolling-share instrument, $\tilde Z_{j,t}$, follows the same reasoning as that for the base-share instrument, $Z_{i,t}$, discussed in \autoref{sec:approp-shocks}.
The base-share instrument is appropriate for some outcomes with the individual Illinois professors, where appropriate.
We satisfy the assumptions for exogeneity by noting that none of the Illinois public campuses take the majority of state funding, and that the identification strategy relies on exogeneity in changes in state funding to individual professor-outcomes, following the year they joined the university.
Additionally, within-institution changes resulting from share reliance on state funding may be correlated with unobserved changes in the outcomes, so that \cite{NBERw27885} note the importance of controlling for the base share and state student population.
The formulation here implicitly controls for these factors via the fixed effects; results are relatively similar while including these controls with and without including fixed effects, and so are omitted.

The instrumental variables model is then defined as follows, where $i(j)$ refers to the institution that professor $j$ is employed at, and $Y_{j,t}$ for salary, rate of promotion, and propensity to leave the Illinois public university system.
The system includes fixed effects for the institution and first year of employment.
The instrument varies by institution, based in the year of first employment, so that these are the corresponding fixed effects and level of clustered standard errors.
\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eqn:secondstage1_indiv}
    X_{i(j),t} &=& \theta_{i(j)} + \phi_{\tau(j)} + \delta \tilde Z_{i(j),t} + \epsilon_{i(j),t} \\
    \label{eqn:secondstage2_indiv}
    Y_{j,t} &=& \mu_{i(j)} + \nu_{\tau(j)} + \beta \widehat X_{i(j),t} + \varepsilon_{j,t}
\end{eqnarray}
We then interpret parameter $\beta$ as the effect of changes in state funding at an Illinois public university, via state funding shocks, on an individual professor's outcome $Y_{j,t}$.

\subsection{Additional Results, Faculty Hiring}
\label{sec:appendix-hiring}

These results were produced by integrating the total count of faculty hires for 2010--2021 for the top-ranked 180 US universities with a sum of the funding variables, and then estimating the models specified in \autoref{sec:iv-model-uni}.
There were no observable differences in the hiring rate of male vs female faculty.

\subsection{Additional Results, Rates of Substitution}
\label{sec:appendix-substitution}

The funding elasticities can be used to recover the marginal rate of substitution between two outcomes.
For example, write $Y^1$ for the number of lecturers per student at a university, and $Y^2$ for the number of full professors.
I use the above approaches to estimate the funding elasticities, where $\% \Delta$ denotes percent change.
\[ \beta_1 = \frac{\% \Delta Y^1}{\% \Delta X}
\text{, and }
\beta_2 = \frac{\% \Delta Y^2}{\% \Delta X} \]
As such, it is possible to recover the elasticity for substitution between lecturers and full professors by the universities via the respective funding elasticities.
\[ \frac{\% \Delta Y^1}{\% \Delta Y^2}
= \frac{\% \Delta Y^1 / \% \Delta X}{\% \Delta Y^2 / \% \Delta X}
= \frac{\beta_1}{\beta_2} \]
I present results for the rates of substitution between different levels of faculty by this approach, dividing the relevant coefficient estimates and presenting standard errors calculated by a non-parametric bootstrap.
In practice, this corresponds to division of the estimates of the elasticity for employment of professors (by rank) with respect to state funding, presented in Panel B \autoref{tab:facultycount-shock-reg}, and bootstrapping the results to generate standard errors and confidence intervals.
% https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63777368/computing-the-standard-error-when-dividing-coefficients-of-different-regressions

The implied marginal rate of substitution between lecturers and assistant professors is estimated as -3.26 (standard error 0.50), based on 10,000 bootstrap samples.
This means that public universities increased their number lecturers per student by 3.26\% when they decreased their count of assistant professors, on average and subject to the changes in state funding they experienced 1990--2017.
Between lecturers and full professors the rate of substitution is -3.19 (0.34), which implies that universities substitute between lecturers and full professors in the same way.
Between assistant and full professors the rate of substitution is 0.99 (0.11), which intuitively implies that universities treated assistant and full professors (i.e., those before and after tenure in the tenure system) as complements.

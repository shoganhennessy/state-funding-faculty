    This figure shows the mean funding for US public universities as a total (in figure a.) and divided by student enrolment (figure b.).
    The numbers are adjusted to 2021 figures by CPI-U.
    Non-institutional revenues refers to the sum of federal, state, and local funding plus tuition revenues; these sum to the majority of university funding, but exclude numbers such as university income from capital projects.
    These figures are calculated in IPEDS data.

    These results use a $\log-\log$ specification, so the estimates are for the elasticity of professor count per student in a year $t+k$ with respect to state funding in year $t$, where years $k = 0, \hdots, 10$ are on the x-axis. 
    Standard errors are clustered at the state-year level.

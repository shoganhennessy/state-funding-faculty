\section{Summary and Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper studies how stagnating state funding for higher education affected faculty, and their composition, at US public universities.
This work contributes to the literature along two primary dimensions.
First, by isolating changes in state funding on public universities via state funding shocks, this work provides an explanation for the increased reliance on lecturers and away from tenure-track and tenured professors at US public universities.
This approach used multiple methods to estimate the short- and medium-run effects of state funding cuts on faculty outcomes.
Second, this work investigates how individual faculty are affected by changes in state funding for their university using a dataset new in the economic literature (IBHED).
These data allow for detailed analysis of thousands of faculty salaries, and employment outcomes in the Illinois university system.

Public universities have systematically substituted away from tenure-track and tenured professors, toward lecturers, in the face of persistent declines in state funding for higher education.
The effects on incumbent professors in Illinois are non-distinguishable from zero, with suggestive evidence for reduced hiring of new professors, implying that the faculty substitution is driven by reduced hiring of new professors.
Public universities are using more contingent lecturers to teach their students, while private universities continue to employ more tenure-track and tenured professors than their public counterparts, and each year the gap widens.

At the same time as higher education costs have been rising in the US, public universities have also dealt with declining state funding.
I show that these headwinds led to systematic change at public universities, changes that affect their faculty, and likely limiting public universities in their goals in research and education.
These results show large changes in faculty composition, and that stagnation in state support explains at least a third of the observed shift away from tenured professors and towards lecturers.
At the same time, private universities were not exposed to financial headwinds of the same magnitude or persistence.
While public universities continue to educate the majority of higher education students in the US, we should worry about the effects of restricting their funding has on faculty, and the wider impact on higher education as a whole.
